# Public Files for Qaafiyah Expert
This repo hosts some files which are served to the Qaafiyah Expert app.

## Links
Download the app from google playstore or have a look at the app live on my website. 
Can't serve an iPhone app via Apple Store, as that's expensive. So use the PWA instead. 100% functioning.

## Why this repo
I wasn't going to implement a notif system in the Qaafiyah Expert, but to inform the users about updates is a must have functionality. 

I was deliberately ignoring the actual notif system, because:
- It will increase the app size
- It won't be used as much, because app isn't content based, except the "Essays" section [Tab4] which is not updated very often
